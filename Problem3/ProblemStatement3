Problem Statement 1:
A car rental agency wants to create a system to manage their car rentals. The system should
allow customers to rent a car by selecting the type of car they want, the rental duration, and the
pick-up and drop-off locations. The agency offers different types of cars, such as economy,
midsize, and luxury, with different rental rates and availability.
The car rental system should be able to do the following:
	1. Display the available cars and their details (type, rental rate, and availability).
	2. Allow customers to rent a car by selecting the type of car they want, the rental duration,
	and the pick-up and drop-off locations.
	3. Calculate the total rental cost based on the rental rate and duration.
	4. Update the availability of cars after a rental is made.
	5. Display the rented cars and their details (type, rental rate, rental duration, pick-up, and
	drop-off locations).
	6. Allow customers to return a rented car and update its availability.
Object-oriented approach:
To implement the above car rental system, we can use the following classes:
	1. Car: This class will contain the details of each car, such as the type, rental rate, and
	availability. It will also have methods to display the car details and update its availability.
	2. Customer: This class will contain the details of each customer, such as the rental
	duration, pick-up, and drop-off locations. It will also have methods to calculate the total
	rental cost and display the rented car details.
	3. CarRentalSystem: This class will act as the main controller of the system. It will contain
	the list of available cars and rented cars and methods to display the available cars, rent
	a car, return a car, and update the car availability.
Using the above classes, we can create objects and use them to interact with the car rental
system. For example, we can create a Car object for each car in the system, a Customer object
for each customer, and a CarRentalSystem object to manage the overall system.
Please consider following edge cases while creating the solution
	1. What happens if a customer tries to rent a car that is not available?
	2. What happens if a customer tries to return a car that was not rented from the rental
	agency?
	3. What happens if a customer wants to extend the rental duration of a car that they have
	already rented?4. What happens if a customer wants to rent a car for a duration that is longer than the
	maximum rental period allowed by the rental agency?
	5. What happens if a customer wants to rent a car from a location that is not a valid pick-up
	location according to the rental agency?
	6. What happens if a customer wants to return a car to a location that is not a valid drop-off
	location according to the rental agency?
	7. What happens if a customer selects a car type that is not offered by the rental agency?
	8. What happens if a customer tries to rent a car for a duration that is less than the
	minimum rental period allowed by the rental agency?
	9. What happens if the rental agency needs to perform maintenance on a car and it
	becomes unavailable for a period of time?
	10. What happens if a customer tries to rent a car but does not have a valid driver's license?
